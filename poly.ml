(* Sum type to encode efficiently polynomial expressions *)
type pExp =
  | Term of int*int (*
      First int is the constant
      Second int is the power of x

      2x -> Term(2,1)
      3x^20 -> Term(3, 20)
    *)
  | Plus of pExp list
  (*
    List of terms added
    Plus([Term(2,1); Term(1,0)])
  *)
  | Times of pExp list (* List of terms multiplied *)


(*
  Function to traslate betwen AST expressions
  to pExp expressions
*)
let from_expr (_e: Expr.expr) : pExp =

(* 
  Compute degree of a polynomial expression.

  Hint 1: Degree of Term(n,m) is m
  Hint 2: Degree of Plus[...] is the max of the degree of args
  Hint 3: Degree of Times[...] is the sum of the degree of args 
*)
let degree (_e:pExp): int = 0 (* TODO *)

(* 
  Comparison function useful for sorting of Plus[..] args 
  to "normalize them". This way, terms that need to be reduced
  show up one after another.
  *)

  degree e1 > degree e2

(* Print a pExpr nicely 
  Term(3,0) -> 3
  Term(5,1) -> 5x 
  Term(4,2) -> 4x^2
  Plus... -> () + () 
  Times ... -> ()() .. ()

  Hint 1: Print () around elements that are not Term() 
  Hint 2: Recurse on the elements of Plus[..] or Times[..]
*)

(* 
  Function to simplify (one pass) pExpr

  n1 x^m1 * n2 x^m2 -> n1*n2 x^(m1+m2)
  Term(n1,m1)*Term(n2,m2) -> Term(n1*n2,m1+m2)

  Hint 1: Keep terms in Plus[...] sorted
  Hint 2: flatten plus, i.e. Plus[ Plus[..], ..] => Plus[..]
  Hint 3: flatten times, i.e. times of times is times
  Hint 4: Accumulate terms. Term(n1,m)+Term(n2,m) => Term(n1+n2,m)
          Term(n1, m1)*Term(n2,m2) => Term(n1*n2, m1+m2)
  Hint 5: Use distributivity, i.e. Times[Plus[..],] => Plus[Times[..],]
    i.e. Times[Plus[Term(1,1); Term(2,2)]; Term(3,3)] 
      => Plus[Times[Term(1,1); Term(3,3)]; Times[Term(2,2); Term(3,3)]]
      => Plus[Term(2,3); Term(6,5)]
  Hint 6: Find other situations that can arise

  Make sure this code works before you work on simplify1
